# C as Backend

Currently the target language is C. That is, the milone-lang compiler reads a source code and translates to a C code. For example, assume the following code is given.

```fsharp
let main _ =
  let rec factorial x =
    if x = 0 then 1 else x * factorial (x - 1)
  factorial 5 - 120 // exit code
```

The compiler emits a C code that is equivalent to the following:

```c
int factorial(int x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return x * factorial(x - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    return factorial(5) - 120;
}
```

*The actual output is available at [factorial.c](../../tests/examples/factorial/factorial.c).*

The diagram below illustrates how it does self-hosting.
