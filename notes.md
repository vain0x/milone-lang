# Notes

## Policy about language extensions

Although some language extensions are necessary, milone-lang should be a subset of F# as possible. That is, language extensions should be used only in libraries, not application-wide.

## Policy about F# language features

No plan to implement complete set of F# features. Especially, these features below are unlikely implemented:

- Code quotations
- Custom computation expressions
- Custom operators
- Inheritance
- Type provider
- Units of measure

### FFI

FFI is absolutely necessary to use milone-lang in somewhat practical purpose.

Open design spaces:

- syntax to declare native functions (~~statically linked~~, dynamically linked)~~ (`__nativeFun` is now available for statically linked ones.)
- C-compatible data types (~~void, int8_t, pointers,~~ enum, struct etc.)
- design of safe wrappers (APIs to indirectly use "unsafe" features without risk of problems)

### Memory management

*In short: No GC. Will support dynamic region-based memory management by deep cloning.*

Unlike F#, milone-lang doesn't support GC.
Compiler is short-running application, so it doesn't need to free anything.

Memory management is necessary for some of long-running programs such as web servers.

As an experiment, milone-lang now supports `__inRegion` primitive that takes a "region", a function (`() -> int`).
`__inRegion` calls the region and returns the result, and then, *all memory allocated while running the region are freed*.

Deallocation by `__inRegion` is safe and sound since *milone-lang doesn't support mutation of objects*,
so that no objects outside of the region point to these memory getting freed.

Using `__inRegion`, at least in theory, I can now write long-running programs in milone-lang like this:

```fs
let work () =
    // Do something here, say, read and write to files.
    // Any memory allocated in this function
    // are freed after the end of calling (`__inRegion` does).
    0

let main _ =
    // Note creating a function object allocates: do this outside of loop.
    let workFn = work

    let rec go () =
        let code = __inRegion workFn
        if code <> 0 then code else go ()
    go ()
```

I want to support `__inRegion` returning any object other than int, especially one including references.
This should be done by deeply cloning the result value of the region: the copy is allocated outside of the region.

- Making "back" references via C FFI (once supported) is not a problem since using C FFI incorrectly causes some memory errors in other "safe" languages too.
- By deeply cloning objects that need allocation, outside of region eventually runs into out of memory.
    - free copies manually? (`let x = __inRegion f in doSomething x; free x`)
    - prevent copies from escaping and free them at the end of scope? (`let x: inref<T> = __inRegion f in doSomething x`)

## Edges

The following illustrates edge cases that F# allows but milone-lang doesn't.

### As pattern syntax

`as` patterns don't parse correctly.

```fs
    match [(1, 2); (3, 4)] with
    | _, _ as xs :: _ as ys ->
      match xs, ys with
      | (1, 2), [(1, 2); (3, 4)] ->
        ()
      | _ ->
        assert false
    | _ ->
      assert false
```

In F#, the two lines are same, but milone-lang doesn't parse the first line.

```fsharp
    |   _, _ as xs  :: _  as ys -> ...
    | ((_, _) as xs :: _) as ys -> ...
```

### Union type syntax without pipes

Defining discriminated unions require `|` in front of all variants.

```fs
    // A is a discriminated union with single case in F#.
    type A = B
    // vs. type A = | B

    // T is synonym of A.
    type T = A
```

### Redundant payload patterns

Const variants can't have payload patterns.

```fs
    type A = | A

    match A with
    | A _ -> () // Notice the `_`.
```
