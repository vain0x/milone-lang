# LibTextProcess

Small text processing libraries as implementation trial.

*Remark (conformance)*: These libraries aren't fully conformant (compatible) to the specification of languages although they should be.

- TinyIni: INI file format implementation. DOM-manipulating parser and writer.
- TinyYaml: YAML-ish file format implementation. DOM-generating parser only.
